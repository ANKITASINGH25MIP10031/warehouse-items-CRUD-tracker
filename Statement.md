# Project Statement – Warehouse Inventory Tracker

## 📝 Problem Statement
Warehouse workers and managers often rely on manual processes such as spreadsheets or handwritten logs to track inventory.  
These methods are time-consuming, prone to human error, and do not provide real-time insights into stock levels.

- Adding, editing, and deleting inventory items  
- Dashboard visualization of inventory statistics  
- Searching, filtering, and sorting data  
- Importing and exporting data  
- Responsive interface suitable for both mobile and desktop  


This scope is designed to cover essential inventory management functionality without requiring a backend or database.
